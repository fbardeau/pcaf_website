	"home-content-1": "Palestine should be recognized as a state to achieve peace. Many countries have recognized it but now citizens, anywhere in the world, have to call for it loudly. This site intendeds to allow everyone to show a peacefull support for the recognition of Palestine as a state, without any hatred for IsraÃ«l, through a very simple and very strong symbolic idea: we propose to fill an application form to get the Palestinian citizenship.",
	"home-content-2": "Citizenship is something very important because it affects identity, and that's why this right has not to be denied to Palestinians, it is obviously an obstacle to peace and the two-state solution. If we are millions to ask for Palestinian Citizenship: who will be able to oppose and stop the recognition of Palestine as a state to millions of people ? And if in every country an important part of people expressed their wish to become Palestinian and therefore to see Palestine recognized: what governments can still oppose or do not work at this recognition against the advice of their own people?",
	"home-content-3": "Our action is positive: in an individual claiming of citizenship of the Palestinian nation, we have a historic opportunity to change the course of things and do it peacefully by referring back to back extremists and weak governments. So let's do it now: asking for the Palestinian citizenship will clearly express our desire to see the State of Palestine recognized and our pried to belong to it when it will finally done.",
	"home-content-4": " This site is not linked to the Palestinian Authority, or Hamas or any other political component, NGOs, religious organization of Palestine, or any other state, neither to terrorist and / or anti-Semitic movements that we take for responsible of the Palestinian people situation and the non-recognition of their state."
